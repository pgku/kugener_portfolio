For this assignment I decided to use a graph that I found in the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report titled “Covid-19: Current and Future Federal Preparedness Requires Fixes to Improve Health Data and Address Improper Payments.” I decided to use a graph from a GAO report because I interned there last summer so I thought that it would be interesting to try and critique a data visualization from a source that I am familiar with. The graph, which is titled "Percentage o COVID-19 Relief Funding Obligated and Expended, July 31, 2020-Feb. 28, 2022" plots the amount of COVID-19 relief funding that was expended versus obligated. In addition, the data visualization includes other information such as the amount of relief funding provided to date and highlight important legislation that was passed. Overall, this is not a bad data visualization graphic but it does fall into some pitfalls such as repitition and poor color choice that if fixed could really help this graphic communicate this important informaiton in a more efficient manner.
