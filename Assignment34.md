# Step one: Find a data visualization

![Image](image2.png)

For this assignment I decided to use a graph that I found in the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report titled “Covid-19: Current and Future Federal Preparedness Requires Fixes to Improve Health Data and Address Improper Payments.” I decided to use a graph from a GAO report because I interned there last summer so I thought that it would be interesting to try and critique a data visualization from a source that I am familiar with. The graph, which is titled "Percentage of COVID-19 Relief Funding Obligated and Expended, July 31, 2020-Feb. 28, 2022" plots the amount of COVID-19 relief funding that was expended and obligated from 2020 to 2022. In addition, the data visualization includes other information such as the amount of relief funding provided to date and highlights important legislation that was passed. Overall, this is not a bad data visualization, but it does have a few issues such as repetition and poor color choice that if fixed could really help this graphic communicate this important information in a more efficient manner. 

# Step two: Critique the data visualization

##  Usefulness - 9

The intended audience for this graph is Congress. I think that the content of the graph is valuable to decision makers in government if they are trying to get an idea of how much COVID-19 relief funding has been used. Additionally, I like how the original graph highlights pieces of legislation that are relevant to the subject matter (such as the American Rescue Plan). I think that the clutter in the graph is harmful especially since the intended audience are policy makers who don't have much time to try and decipher everything that is being presented. Overall, I think that this graph is really useful, which is why I evaluated it at a 9, but that it could take in account the amount of time that its audience has and try and streamline the information it is trying to communicate. 

##  Completeness - 9

I think that the visualization has everything necessary to make it understandable which is why I gave it a 9, but that sometimes it overloads the viewer with information. For example there is a lot of repetition in the data visualization such as including the percetages for expended and obligated above each data point. I don't think that the graphic has any unnessecary information, but just that it could be a bit more concise. 

##  Perceptibility - 4

I gave this visualization a 4 in terms of perceptibility because I feel like there is an overload of information. The different fonts and the many types of dates make it more difficult to get the information that you are interested in out of the data visualization. I do think that the line graph is an appropriate type of visualization for this type of information. It really does highlight the difference in the obligated and expended funds and having all the points connect allows the viewer to see the overall trend in the data. The reason for this low score though was because of the amount of information that is being repeated in the graphic. 

##  Truthfulness - 10

For truthfulness I gave this graph a perfect 10 because I feel like it is not trying to mislead the reader. Additionally, I don't see any issue with the scale of this graph and I actually really appreciate the fact that they included the "//" to skip over 0-45 on the y axis since there is no need to see those numbers. 

##  Intuitiveness - 3

This graphic has a low intuitiveness score because of the fact that there is a lot of information in it and it is pretty difficult to understand what is being shown. I feel like this graph is difficult to understand because of the nature of the data. For example, are the percentages just showing the percentage of the amount provided to date that has been used? Also, what is the definition of obligated and expended in this context? I think the complexity of this graph is supported by the fact that there is a very long notes section underneath with which addresses some of the peculiarities in this graph. 

##  Aesthetics- 3

I gave this graphic a 3 for aesthetics due primarily with how cluttered I feel like it is. Some of the purely aesthetic issues I have with the graphic include the decision to make the expended line dashed and the obligated line solid. I feel like the expended line should be solid because that money has been spent whereas it would be more appropriate to make the obligated line dashed because that money has simply been committed to something but has not yet been spent. Though this is a small point I think that these subtle aesthetic cues could really help viewers understand the impact of the data being shown.

##  Engagement - 6

I gave this graphic a 6 for engagement because I feel like it achieves its goal of communicating information on COVID-19 relief funding but that the information isn't telling much of a story. I think that it is a missed opportunity to have all the data on the funding amounts and to not include that in the graph. Since it is just text it is hard to tell what the trends are and to really understand how these funding amounts changed.

# Step three: Sketch out a solution

I sketched out a solution that included turning the line plot into a series of bar graphs. I felt like that would more accurately represent the data included in the original graph. Additionally, I tried to remove as much of the repetition as I could from the bottom part of the graph. I feel like this makes the overall graph appear a bit lighter. One item that I was a bit confused about how to show was the "amount provided to date (trillion)." In the original data visualization it is included below the graph but the formatting choices made it difficult to access the information. I feel like I will need to try and get feedback as to how I should integrate that metric into the data visualization.

# Step four: Test the solution

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
A graph showing the difference between funding spent versus set aside after certain acts.
- Can you describe to me what the graph is trying to say?
That we have not spent all the money that has been allocated to help with COVID-19. 
- Is there anything about it that is confusing?
I am confused about the row of money at bottom and how it connects to the percentages.
- Who do you think is the intended audience?
Congress.
- Is there anything you would change?
Make it more clear how much money is not being spent.

- Can you tell me what you think this is?/ Can you describe to me what the graph is trying to say?
It’s a graph! It is showing the amount of money for COVID-19 relief that was offered and the amount that was actually spent over the course of July 2020 to Feb 2022 and the discrepancy of the amount that was spent versus offered. 
- Is there anything about it that is confusing?
Percent of what for the obligation and expended. What is it a percentage of?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Not me. People who are auditing spending within or outside the government.
- Is there anything you would change?
What is confusing is that the numbers underneath the dates on the axis... is that how much money was provided? How does that connect to obligated and expended? A clarification on COVID-19 relief funding, is it from a specific office or for a program? Where that data comes from.

I found getting outside perspective about my sketch to be really interesting. Both individuals that I interviewed had similar issues with the sketch but also provided different insights. Overall, they both found the "amount provided to date" to be a bit confusing and they also had some problems understanding what was going on with the percentages. Hopefully my final graph will help to clarify these issues.

# Step five: Build your solution

Above is my final data visualization. What I tried to do was take the information presented in the original graph and try and tell a story with it. In order to do that I used a dual axis which is a bit different but I think really allows the viewer to see how the relationship between the change in the amount of funding allocated and the obligated and expended numbers. I also decided to highlight the two acts that the original graphic had because as you can see in the graph, after both acts the amount of funding increases. I thought that this was a missed opportunity in the original data visualization which is why I included in my new version. I think that including the funding amount as a line was necessary to really get the most out of having that information in the first place. Finally, I switched up the color choices to make it a bit brighter and exciting. Also, I want to point out one of the attributes that I kept from the original graphic which was how they decided to cut down the y axis. I thought that it was a really good choice and really helps the data visualization not become overwhelmed with so much solid color. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot about how much trial and error goes into recreating a data visualization and how getting outside perspectives really help you to understand how your work is being viewed.
