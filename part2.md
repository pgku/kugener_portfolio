## User research and interviews

### User research protocol

My target audience for this data visualization story are individuals who are interested in politics and like to read data stories from websites such as FiveThirtyEight. I also think that this story would be of interest to individuals who like data and want to see how policy choices, such as the congressional districts that are drawn every ten years, can impact how the people are represented in the government. My approach for identifying representative individuals is to look for people who are either actively engageed in politics or who like to learn about public policy. I am very fortunate since Heinz is full of people who are interested in the impacts of public policy. 

#### Interview script

My focus in creating my interview script was to get overall feedback on my wireframe and to get some feedback on some aspects that I have been nervous about. In particular I wanted to make sure that the infographics and data visualizations were not overly complicated. I also wanted to get of sense of the flow and to see if the story was able to build on itself and that I wasn't assuming that the reader had a lot of previous knowledge on the subject. Finally, I have been worried that the color scheme is too intense and so this opportunity was a good time to get an idea of what a reader thinks. 

Below I have included my questions:

- What did you think of the flow of the presentation?
- Do the graphs enhance the story?
- What do you think of the color scheme? Is it too red, white, and blue?
- Any thoughts on the infographics? Are they clear?
- Is anything confusing?
