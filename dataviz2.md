# Data Visualization Assignment 2: Visualizations with OCED data

The following graphs explore the General Government Debt dataset from the OCED using different data visualization techniques. The General Government Debt dataset includes the debt-to-GDP measurement which is the percentage of gross debt a country has compared to their GDP. A large debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that a country's debt is high compared to its GDP. Each of the following data visualizations focus on different aspects of the data and aim to highlight interesting trends in the debt-to-GDP ratios across various countries.

## Discussion

Each of the data visualizations above have their own purposes and are very important to the data exploration part of creating graphs. The first graph, the bar chart, allows the viewer to quickly get an idea of the data and see how the debt-to-GDP ratio looked across countries in 2020. The second graph, the grid of line charts, helps the viewer understand how a country's debt-to-GDP ratio has changed over time. The first graph allows the viewer to compare across countries while the second graph allows the viewer to compare a country to itself. While both of these graphs are very important, especially in the data exploration phase, neither of them tell a story or try to get the viewer to think beyond what the data looks like. With the third graph, the connected dot plot, I tried to tell more of a story with the data using what I learned from the first two graphs. For this visualization I focused on five years instead of one, like the first visualization, or the entire range, like the second visualization. I also chose to color the data for 2021 red since it was the most recent piece of information. The rest of the points were in a gray gradient with time moving forward from the lightest to the darkest shade. Now the viewer can get a quick sense of how a country's debt-to-GDP ratio has changed over time and easily see how its most recent ratio compares to its history. The downside to the third visualization is that just picking five years could be oversimplifying the totality of the data and a country's economic history. That is why I think that these three visualizations work really well together since the information one graph shows complements what is being shown in another.
