# Final Project Part III

## Thoughts on the Final Presentation Process

Creating the final project presentation required a lot more work than I initially thought. Actually putting otgether the content for my Shorthand presentation uncovered gaps in how I was presenting the information. I realized that since my topic was pretty specific and technical using visuals could really help and guide the reader through my theory. Overall, I am really happy with how the presentation turned out because I think that breaking down the theory for an audience who might not know anything about my theory really helped me to not only better understand what I was saying but also to see my topic from a different direction. 

In terms of creating the final presentation materials I had some difficulties in the later stages due to issues with Tableau and Shorthand. I ran into a problem when taking a closer look at the maps I created in Tableau where I realized it was using the Congressional Districts that have just been drawn. Unfortunately, I do not have any data for elections that have occured with these new maps so I had to find a shapefile for the previous Congressional district maps in addition to a FIPS code file that could connect the Shapefile to my data. It was difficult but it was really interesting to get the opportunity to use Tableau's table joining capabilities. Regarding Shorthand, I had some problems with how my data visualizations were displaying that took a lot of trial and error to figure out. Overall, I am really proud of how my presentation came out aestheically, especially how my cracking and packing infographic works alongside the text. I think that my favorite visualziation has to be the scrollpoint map I created with three states that have a history of gerrymandering. I think that not only did it turn out really cool but, in my opinion, it also is the best way to present that information. 

I also had to redefine my call to action as I was putting together my final presentation. I realized that my audience was different than what I initially had in mind. At first I thought that I would be creating a FiveThirtyEight type of article but I did not take into account how much work goes into a piece like that. Even after putting many hours into my presentation I would say that I am still in the beginning steps of creating a fully realized political data story. Therefore I decided to think of this more as a proof of concept presentation that I would make to a Political Science professor in order to get them to help me with my research or provide me with funding. After I made that decision I realized that the takeaway wasn't about making sure people vote or that they learn more about the process, instead it was to say that this topic is worth investing in.  

Finally, thinking through how I would present my topic was a difficult task. I knew that some individuals might not be familiar with US politics which made figuring out how to present the information in a way that would make sense to the audience difficult. With only a minute I decided that I would not have enough time to talk about what cracking and packing mean and that jumping to the data visualizations might be a better strategy. Now reflecting on how the presentation went I think that just sticking to the basics might have been better.

Overall, I really enjoyed creating a presentation on a topic that I am really passionate about using tools such as Tableau and Shorthand. Not only did I get to present data that I had already seen in a better way but I actually think that I deepened my understanding of this topic. Breaking down my idea in simple pieces for an audience that might not know much about the topic really has helped my critical thinking process and I think that it is a tactic that I will use from now on. Not only did a lot of data visualization and editing go into creating this final presentation but I also did a lot of reflection on why I am passionate about this topic.
