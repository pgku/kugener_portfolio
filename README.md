# About me

My name is Philippine Kugener (she/her) and I am a student at Heinz College pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management with a focus on data analytics. I have a background in Political Science and Visual and Dramatic Arts (Studio Art) which I hope to apply to towards creating impactful and useful data visualizations for organizations in the private or public sector. 

# What I hope to learn

Over the course of this mini I hope to learn how to combine my data analytics skills with my background in visual arts to create cohesive data visualizations. Once I graduate, I plan on working for either a consulting company or local government to help leverage their data in order to inform the organization's decision-making processes.
